The latest source code of the Keyri iOS SDK can be found here: <https://github.com/Keyri-Co/keyri-ios-whitelabel-sdk/releases>

### **System Requirements**

*   iOS 14+

*   Swift 5+

*   Apple A7 chip or newer (The A7 shipped with the iPhone 5s)

### **Integration**

****[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Keyri iOS SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'keyri-pod'
```

The SDK can then be imported into any Swift file as follows

```swift
import keyri-pod
```

### **Option 1 - Universal Links**

To handle Universal Links (e.g., for QR login straight from the user's built-in camera app), you need to add the Associated Domains Entitlement to your App.entitlements. To set up the entitlement in your app, open the targetâ€™s Signing & Capabilities tab in Xcode and add the Associated Domains capability, or if you already have entitlements you can modify your App.entitlements file to match this example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
	<array>
		<string>applinks:{domainName}</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

This will handle all links with the following scheme: `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to?sessionId={sessionId}`

**Note:** Keyri will create your `https://{yourCompany}.onekey.to` page automatically once you configure it in the [dashboard](https://app.keyri.com)

In the AppDelegate where the processing of links is declared, you need to add handlers in the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL
    else {
        return false
    }
    
    process(url: incomingURL)
    
    return true
}

func process(url: URL) {
    let sessionId = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)?.queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "sessionId" })?.value ?? ""
    let payload = "Custom payload here"
    let appKey = selectedAppKey // Get this value from the Keyri Developer Portal

    let keyri = Keyri() // Be sure to import the SDK at the top of the file
    let res = keyri.initializeQrSession(username: "lol", sessionId: sessionId, appKey: appKey) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let session):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                session.payload = payload
                keyri.initializeDefaultScreen(sessionId: session.sessionId) { bool in
                    print(bool)
                }
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
        
    }
```

**Note:** Keyri will set up the required `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` JSON at your `https://{yourSubdomain}.onekey.to` page as required by Apple to handle Universal Link handling. Details on this mechanism are described here: <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/supporting-associated-domains>

### **Option 2 - In-App Scanner**

This can be used in conjunction with Universal links or exclusively.

The Keyri SDK includes a default Scanner view, which can be invoked and displayed as shown below. Unfortunately, due to platform limitations, we had to keep this in UIKit for the time being, but will be on the lookout for options to convert over to SwiftUI as time goes on. The completion block is the important piece here: we return the exact string as shown in the QR code. All you need to do is convert to URL, and then you're free to process the response the same way we did above (notice the `process(url)` function is exactly the same in both cases)

```swift
ptfunc handleDisplayingScanner() {
    let scanner = Scanner()
    scanner.completion = { str in 
        guard let url = URL(string: str) else { return nil }
        process(url)
    }

    scanner.show()
}

func process(url: URL) {
    let sessionId = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)?
    .queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "sessionId" })?.value ?? ""
    let payload = "Custom payload here"
    let appKey = "App key here" // Get this value from the Keyri Developer Portal

    let keyri = Keyri() // Be sure to import the SDK at the top of the file
    let res = keyri.initializeQrSession(appKey: appKey, sessionId: sessionId, payload: payload)

    switch res {
    case .success(let session):
        // You can optionally create a custom screen and pass the session ID there. We recommend this approach for large enterprises
        initializeDefaultScreen(session)

        // In a real world example youâ€™d wait for user confirmation first
        session.confirm() // or session.deny()
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
        
    
}
```

### **Interacting with the API**

The following methods are available to interact with the Keyri SDK API, which can be used to craft your own custom flows and leverage the SDK in different ways:

*   `func initiateQrSession(sessionId: String, appKey: String): Result<Session, Error>` - call after obtaining the sessionId from QR-code or deep link. Returns Session object with Risk attributes (needed to show confirmation screen) or Exception.

*   `func initializeDefaultConfirmationScreen(session: Session): Boolean` - to show Confirmation with default UI. Alternatively, you can implement a custom Confirmation Screen. The Default screen is built using SwiftUI, however the session object is designed to work seamlessly with UIKit as well should you prefer that route

*   `func Session.confirm(publicUserId: String?, payload: String):Result<Bool, Error>` - call this function if user confirms the dialog. Returns authentication result.

*   `func Session.deny(publicUserId: String?, payload: String): Result<Bool, Error> ` - call if the user denys the dialog. Returns authentication result.

*   `func generateAssociationKey(publicUserId: String): String` - creates a persistent ECDSA keypair for the given public user ID (example: email address) and return public key.

*   `func getUserSignature(publicUserId: String?, customSignedData: String?): String` - returns an ECDSA signature of the timestamp and optional customSignedData with the publicUserId's privateKey (or, if not provided, anonymous privateKey), customSignedData can be anything.

*   `func getAssociationKey(publicUserId: String): String` - returns Base64 public key for the specified publicUserId.

*   `func removeAssociationKey(publicUserId: String)` - removes key for given user, deleting their record

*   `func listAssociationKeys(): [String: String]` - returns a map of username to association key, every such key on the device

`payload` can be anything (session token or a stringified JSON containing multiple items. Can include things like publicUserId, timestamp, customSignedData and ECDSA signature).

### **Session Object**

The session object is returned on successful initalizeQrSession calls, and is used to handle presenting the situation to the end user and getting their confirmation to complete authentication. Below are some of the key properties and methods that can be triggered. If you are utilizing the built-in views, you are only responsible for calling the confirm/deny methods above

*   IPAddressMobile/Widget - the IP Address of both mobile device and web browser&#x20;

*   WidgetUserAgent - the browser user-agent (e.g., Chrome on macOS)&#x20;

*   RiskAnalytics - if available on your subscription plan

    *   RiskStatus - clear, warn or deny

    *   RiskFlagString - if RiskStatus is warn or deny, this string alerts the user to what is triggering the risk situation

    *   GeoData - Location data for both mobile and widget

        *   Mobile

            *   city

            *   country\_code

        *   Browser

            *   city

            *   country\_code

*   Session.confirm() and Session.deny() - see descriptions in **Interacting with the API**
